Data scraping and data analysis project with Python (beautifulsoup, pandas) and ms excel. 

- The first file is Best Selling English Book Analysis With Python and Ms Excel, this is an excel file containing a final product of this project, the idea is simply to get insight of what genre of English books which has best selling predicate based on its sum of approximate sales information from wikipedia. 

- The second file is, wiki.py, it's a simple program created to retrieve and filtered the data needed from wikipedia webpage
(techs used can be seen in the imported libraries) 

-The third file is, genre-scrp.py, a program that created to gain some missing values in first data retrieval. 


These are simple steps to gain insight from this project:

1. Open the wiki.py in your text editor (I recommend to use visual studio code)
2. Run the program, in the terminal you will see all the data retrieved and filtered using various tools and python library
  (mostly pandas and regex) 
3. A CSV file also created named wikidataframe.csv
4. Open Ms Excel, click new workbook, click Data tab, click from text, select wikidataframe.csv, and check commas and tabs delemiter
5. a fiew minor data cleansing should be applied in order to get a cleaner view of the data
6. There are some missing data in the wikipediaframe.csv, mostly in genre column. 
7. open the genre-scrap.py, run it, and it will show you all the missing data(genre)
8. follow the same instruction to open the csv file into excel file.
